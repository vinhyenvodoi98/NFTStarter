✅ Why Your Submission?





🌍 Explain why the project stands out and its core benefits.





1. Lazy Minting:

- The project employs lazy minting, which allows NFTs to be created without upfront gas costs. This reduces barriers for creators, enabling them to onboard easily without worrying about high transaction fees.

- NFTs are only minted on-chain when they are purchased or claimed, making the system more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly by minimizing unnecessary blockchain activity.



2. Cross-Layer NFT Bridging:

- The ability to bridge NFTs between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) can bring a lot of user to starknet
